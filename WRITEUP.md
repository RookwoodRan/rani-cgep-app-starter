# Acme Health: GRC Engineering Capstone Write-up

## Primary framework

My primary framework is **CMMC Level 2**, expressed through the NIST SP 800-171 requirements it is built on. I chose it over the HIPAA Security Rule and SOC 2 for three reasons. First, the starter's GAPS.md already maps each gap to a CMMC practice, so every Rego policy cites a real control ID instead of a loose analogy. Second, NIST publishes 800-171 as an official OSCAL catalog, so anyone can follow my component definition to the catalog and check each claim; I did not find an equivalent catalog published by the framework owners for SOC 2 or for the HIPAA Security Rule. Third, the controls Acme's gaps touch (cryptography, boundary protection, least privilege) are the families CMMC states most concretely, which kept each claim testable.

One caveat I want to state plainly. CMMC Level 2 is currently assessed against NIST SP 800-171 **Revision 2**, and the DoD has said it will move to Revision 3 through later rulemaking ([DoD CIO alignment document](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/CMMC/CMMC-AlignmentNIST-Standards.pdf)). The OSCAL catalog I link is the Revision 3 catalog (`NIST_SP800-171_rev3_catalog.json`), because that is the version NIST publishes in OSCAL. For the five practices I claim, the requirement numbers are the same in both revisions (for example 3.13.11 and 03.13.11), so the CMMC practice IDs in my Rego policies and the Rev 3 control IDs in my OSCAL describe the same requirement. The wording differs slightly between revisions, and I say where that matters below.

## Control coverage

Six of the eight gaps in GAPS.md are closed in Terraform **and** enforced by a Rego policy. Terraform closes the gap; the policy fails closed if anyone reintroduces it. Two gaps are not addressed (see the last section).

| Gap | What was wrong | CMMC practice | NIST 800-171 Rev 3 | Terraform fix | Rego policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GAP-01 | Uploads bucket on the AWS default key | SC.L2-3.13.11 | 03.13.11 | `hardening.tf`: SSE-KMS with our key (`kms.tf`, rotation on) | `sc13_11_s3_cmk.rego` |
| GAP-02 | DynamoDB table on an AWS-owned key | SC.L2-3.13.11 | 03.13.11 | `main.tf`: `server_side_encryption` with our key | `sc13_11_dynamodb_cmk.rego` |
| GAP-03 | No TLS-only bucket policy | SC.L2-3.13.8 | 03.13.08 | `hardening.tf`: deny when `aws:SecureTransport` is false (also on the vault) | `sc13_8_tls.rego` |
| GAP-04 | No S3 versioning | MP.L2-3.8.9 | 03.08.09 | `hardening.tf`: versioning enabled | `mp3_8_9_versioning.rego` |
| GAP-05 | Lambda outside the VPC | SC.L2-3.13.1 | 03.13.01 | `main.tf` + `lambda-vpc.tf`: private subnets, endpoints, locked-down security group | `sc13_1_lambda_vpc.rego` |
| GAP-07 | `dynamodb:*` and `s3:*` on the Lambda role | AC.L2-3.1.5 | 03.01.05 | `main.tf`: exact actions and resource ARNs | `ac3_1_5_least_privilege.rego` |
| GAP-06 | No concurrency limit, DLQ, or tracing | SI.L2-3.14.6 | n/a | Not addressed | None |
| GAP-08 | No API access logging, throttling, or WAF | AU.L2-3.3.1 | n/a | Not addressed | None |

Beyond the gaps, the baseline adds a customer-managed key for the evidence vault, an Object Lock evidence bucket, and a multi-region CloudTrail with log file validation.

**An honest note on GAP-04.** MP.L2-3.8.9 (and Rev 3's 03.08.09) is about protecting the confidentiality of backups. Versioning gives recoverability, not confidentiality; the stored versions are encrypted with the customer key, which is where the confidentiality comes from. It is the weakest mapping in my set, so the OSCAL marks it `partial` and the description says why.

**Policy design.** There are six policies, 35 tests, and one shared helper library. Each policy has a METADATA block with the control ID, framework, gap, severity, and remediation, and each deny message starts with the control ID. The policies read the `configuration` section of the Terraform plan, not the planned values. Configuration keeps constants and references even when a value is "known after apply", so the policies work on a fresh account and not only on an incremental plan. For the same reason, IAM and bucket policies must be written with `aws_iam_policy_document`; a policy written as a `jsonencode` string cannot be inspected at plan time, so the gate treats it as a failure.

## Design decisions

**Region: ca-central-1.** It is the closest region to me, keeps the data in Canada, and offers every service the stack uses. I set it in `variables.tf`, in the bootstrap stack, and in the pipeline, and pinned the apply role to it.

**Object Lock mode: GOVERNANCE, 30 days.** COMPLIANCE is the stronger chain-of-custody claim, because nobody (not even root) can delete evidence early. It also cannot be undone, and this is a sandbox I need to be able to tear down. GOVERNANCE lets a privileged human bypass the lock, so I closed the part of that gap I could control: the pipeline's apply role has an explicit deny on `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention`, object deletion, and changes to the lock configuration. The pipeline can add evidence but can never remove or unlock it. In production I would use COMPLIANCE.

**Apply automatically on merge.** The Conftest gate is the control, and in a sandbox the blast radius of a bad apply is small. I limited the deploy power instead of adding a human gate: pull requests assume a read-only plan role that cannot change anything, and only the `main` branch can assume the apply role, which is restricted to one region, to the services the stack uses, and to IAM roles named `acme-health-intake-*`. A branch ruleset on `main` requires a pull request and a passing `grc-gate` check, with an empty bypass list, so even I cannot merge a red change. For real PHI I would add a manual approval before apply.

**Single AWS account.** Everything lives in one account for this project. The cost is that a compromise of the audited account could in principle reach the evidence. For production I would put the vault in a separate account that the pipeline can write to but the workload account cannot touch.

**Terraform versus policy.** I did both for every targeted gap. Terraform is what actually fixes the infrastructure; the policy is what stops the fix from quietly regressing. A policy-only approach would block bad changes but leave the gap open today, and a Terraform-only approach would fix today and not notice tomorrow's regression.

**Other choices worth naming.**
- *Evidence is signed even when the gate fails.* The gate step records its result and lets the job continue; the last step turns that result into a red build. A blocked change is exactly the run an assessor wants a record of.
- *The OIDC trust lists both subject formats* (`repo:OWNER/REPO` and `repo:OWNER@ID/REPO@ID`), because GitHub issues the subject claim in either format depending on the repository, and a trust policy that lists only one can reject a valid run.
- *The deploy roles live in a separate `bootstrap/` Terraform root.* The main stack's own least-privilege policy would rightly flag the broad permissions a deploy role needs, and a pipeline should not be able to rewrite its own permissions.
- *Terraform state is in an S3 bucket* (versioned, encrypted, private, TLS only) with native lock files, so the laptop and the pipeline see the same state.
- *The CloudTrail log bucket is exempt from the customer-key and versioning policies only.* It holds audit logs, not PHI. It is still subject to the TLS policy.

## How the pipeline produces evidence

One workflow, `.github/workflows/grc-gate.yml`, runs as a single connected flow:

1. **Plan.** `terraform plan` produces the saved plan.
2. **Policy gate.** `scripts/policy-gate.sh` converts the plan to JSON and runs Conftest against all six policy namespaces. The result decides what happens next.
3. **Apply.** Only on a push to `main`, and only if the gate passed, the exact reviewed plan is applied.
4. **Sign.** The evidence folder (plan, gate results, run metadata) is bundled and signed keyless with Cosign; the signature, the Fulcio certificate, and the Rekor entry go into one file.
5. **Store.** The bundle, its SHA-256, the signature, and a receipt are written to the Object Lock vault.
6. **Enforce.** A final step fails the build if the gate failed, so signing happens either way.

Runs an assessor can verify (all in the vault `acme-health-intake-evidence-08fa0596`):

| Run | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `42547179941` | PR #1, green: the whole baseline, plan role, gate passed, apply skipped by design |
| `42550227346` | PR #2, **red**: a regression suspending uploads versioning was blocked by `[MP.L2-3.8.9]`; apply skipped; evidence still signed and stored |
| `42706911885` | Merge to `main`, **real apply**: gate passed, the apply role changed the PHI key's labels in AWS (1 changed), then the run was signed and stored |

`bash scripts/verify-evidence.sh 42706911885` re-checks three things: the SHA-256 recomputes, the Cosign signature verifies against this repository's workflow identity, and the Object Lock retention is still in the future. Each of the runs above prints `CHAIN INTACT`. The OSCAL component links its claims to these bundles by vault URI, version ID, and hash, and `python scripts/build_oscal.py --check` confirms every link resolves and every hash matches.

I also learned that the first merge to `main` (run `42548157532`) applied nothing, because I had applied the baseline by hand earlier. That is why I made a deliberate one-line change afterwards, so that the apply step would do real work through the pipeline.

## Trade-offs and what I would do with another sprint

- **Deploy role permissions.** The apply role uses service-level wildcards (for example `ec2:*`), limited by region and by a deny list around the vault. Listing every action would be brittle. With more time I would generate a minimal policy from CloudTrail activity with IAM Access Analyzer and replace the wildcards.
- **Static checks only see configuration.** The gate checks what Terraform intends, not what is running. Someone could change a resource in the console after the apply. I would add a scheduled drift run (plan on a timer, same gate and signing) and AWS Config rules for the same controls.
- **Spurious plan changes.** Because I moved policies to `aws_iam_policy_document`, a plan that changes a key shows the IAM policy as "known after apply". The apply found no real difference. It is harmless, but it makes plans noisier.
- **Partial fit for MP.L2-3.8.9** (explained above). A real backup solution with its own encryption would close it properly.
- **Manual approval and COMPLIANCE lock** for production, and the separate vault account.
- **The state bucket uses SSE-S3**, not a customer-managed key. I would move it to a key for consistency.
- **Public repository.** The Actions logs show resource names and the AWS account number. There are no secrets in this stack, but a real PHI system would keep logs private.
- **Pinned tool versions** (Terraform 1.16.0, Conftest 0.56.0, Cosign 2.2.4) keep runs reproducible, and they need deliberate upgrades.

## What I didn't get to

- **GAP-06** (SI.L2-3.14.6): no reserved concurrency, dead-letter queue, or X-Ray tracing on the Lambda. I would close it with `reserved_concurrent_executions`, a `dead_letter_config`, and `tracing_config`, plus a Rego policy for each, following the same pattern as the other six.
- **GAP-08** (AU.L2-3.3.1): no API Gateway access logging, throttling, or WAF. CloudTrail is deployed and records account-level activity, but I did not claim AU.L2-3.3.1 in the OSCAL because request-level logging for the API is still missing. I would add access logs to a CloudWatch log group on the stage, throttling settings, and a WAF web ACL.
- **A system security plan** and any assessment results in OSCAL; the component definition and profile are what I built.

## How this was built

I built this Capstone with assistance from Claude for drafting code and expediting document drafting. I was solely responsible for running every command, testing the results, and all design decisions. I can explain each choice that was made in this write-up.
